# FriendFinder
## Try this compatibility-based "FriendFinder" demo application.

This is a full-stack site which takes in users survey results, then compares their answers with those from other users and displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

For demonstration purposes, some other users' data has been created in advance. See who your most compatible friend is and, if you want, you can clear and re-create the seed data. Make up your own user profiles and add some picture links.
